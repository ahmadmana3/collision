(For Example, people tend to drink on friday or saturday night, drunk people loves to speeding, speeding lead to collisions).  \n\nThe main purpose for the project to provide advices for target audience such as police , rescue group ,insurance companies and drivers themselves to make insightful decision it could help to reducing accident and accident severity.\n"
